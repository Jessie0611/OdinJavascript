    <h2>Beginning Javascript</h2>
    <p><strong>console.log() </strong>is the command to print something to the developer console in your browser.
    <br> You can use this to print the results from any of the following articles and exercises to the console.</p>
    <p> JavaScript files have the extension .js similar to .css for stylesheets. External JavaScript files are used for more complex scripts. 
    <br> script src="javascript.js"  /script </p>
    <h2>The 8 data types of JavaScript are:</h2>
    <p><b>Number</b>: represents both integer and floating-point numbers.
    <br><b>String</b>: represents a sequence of characters enclosed within quotes.
    <br><b>Boolean</b>: represents a logical value, either true or false.
    <br><b>Undefined</b>: represents a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value.
    <br><b>Null</b>: represents the intentional absence of any object value.
    <br><b>Symbol</b>: represents a unique value that's not equal to any other value.
    <br><b>Object</b>: represents a collection of properties, and each property is a key-value pair.
    <br><b>BigInt</b>: represents integers with arbitrary precision.
    <br>It's important to note that JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, meaning that you don't have to specify the data type of a variable when you declare it. Instead, the data type is inferred based on the value assigned to the variable.</p>
<h2>Variables</h2>
    <p>You can think of variables as simply “storage containers” for data in your code. Until recently there was only one way to create a variable in JavaScript — the var statement. But in the newest JavaScript versions we have two more ways — let and const.
<br>Now, we can put some data into it by using the assignment operator =:
<br> let message; <br>
<br>message = 'Hello'; // store the string 'Hello' in the variable named message
<br> <br> <br>
<p>The string is now saved into the memory area associated with the variable. We can access it using the variable name: <br>
    let message; <br>
message = 'Hello!'; <br>
<br>
alert(message); // shows the variable content <br>
</p> <br>
<p>To be concise, we can combine the variable declaration and assignment into a single line: <br>
    let message = 'Hello!'; // define the variable and assign the value <br>
<br>
alert(message); // Hello!
</p> <br>
<p>We can also declare multiple variables in one line: <br>
    let user = 'John', age = 25, message = 'Hello'; <br>
</p>
<p>The multiline variant is a bit longer, but easier to read: <br>
    let user = 'John'; <br>
    let age = 25; <br>
    let message = 'Hello'; <br>
</p>
    </p>

      <script>
    // Your JavaScript goes here!
    console.log("Hello, World!")
    let hello = 'Hello world!';

let message;

// copy 'Hello world' from hello into message
message = hello;

// now two variables hold the same data
alert(hello); // Hello world!

const myBirthday = '06.11.1991';
const COLOR_RED = "#F00";
const COLOR_GREEN = "#0F0";
const COLOR_BLUE = "#00F";
const COLOR_ORANGE = "#FF7F00";
     </script>
