    <p><b>Problem solving is the core thing software developers do.</b> The programming languages and tools they use are secondary to this fundamental skill.
        <br>
        The best way to improve your problem solving ability is by building experience by making lots and lots of programs. The more practice you have the better you’ll be prepared to solve real world problems.
<h2>Understand the Problem</h2>
   The first step to solving a problem is understanding exactly what the problem is. If you don’t understand the problem, you won’t know when you’ve successfully solved it and may waste a lot of time on a wrong solution.
<br>
To gain clarity and understanding of the problem, write it down on paper, reword it in plain English until it makes sense to you, and draw diagrams if that helps. When you can explain the problem to someone else in plain English, you understand it.
<br>
<h2>Plan</h2>
   Now that you know what you’re aiming to solve, don’t jump into coding just yet. It’s time to plan out how you’re going to solve it first. Some of the questions you should answer at this stage of the process:
<br>
<ul>
    <li>Does your program have a user interface? What will it look like? What functionality will the interface have? Sketch this out on paper.</li>
    <li>What inputs will your program have? Will the user enter data or will you get input from somewhere else? </li>
    <li>What’s the desired output? </li>
    <li>Given your inputs, what are the steps necessary to return the desired output? </li>
</ul>
The last question is where you will write out an algorithm to solve the problem. You can think of an algorithm as a recipe for solving a particular problem. It defines the steps that need to be taken by the computer to solve a problem in pseudocode. <br>
 <h2>Divide BIG problems into Sub-Problems so you don't cry.</h2>
If you get stuck try to solve a more simple problem then expand on it. Use Google after (only on sub problems not the big problem) because you can learn from other peoples solutions. Struggle = Learning!
        <h2>Pseudocode/Practice</h2>
        Pseudocode is writing out the logic for your program in natural language instead of code. It helps you slow down and think through the steps your program will have to go through to solve the problem.

    <p><b>Element Creation:</b> <br>document.createElement(tagName, [options]) - creates a new element of tag type tagName. [options] in this case means you can add some optional parameters to the function. Don’t worry about these at this point. <br><br>
<b>Query Selectors: </b><br>
element.querySelector(selector) - returns a reference to the first match of selector. <br>
element.querySelectorAll(selectors) - returns a “NodeList” containing references to all of the matches of the selectors. <br> <br>
<b>Append Elements: </b> <br>
parentNode.appendChild(childNode) - appends childNode as the last child of parentNode. <br>
parentNode.insertBefore(newNode, referenceNode) - inserts newNode into parentNode before referenceNode. <br> <br>
<b>Remove Elements: </b> <br>
parentNode.removeChild(child) - removes child from parentNode on the DOM and returns a reference to child. <br> <br>
