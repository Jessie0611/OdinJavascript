    <h2>Beginning Javascript</h2>
    <p>
        Problem solving is the core thing software developers do. The programming languages and tools they use are secondary to this fundamental skill.
        <br>
        The best way to improve your problem solving ability is by building experience by making lots and lots of programs. The more practice you have the better you’ll be prepared to solve real world problems.
        <h2>Understand the Problem</h2>
        The first step to solving a problem is understanding exactly what the problem is. If you don’t understand the problem, you won’t know when you’ve successfully solved it and may waste a lot of time on a wrong solution.
<br>
To gain clarity and understanding of the problem, write it down on paper, reword it in plain English until it makes sense to you, and draw diagrams if that helps. When you can explain the problem to someone else in plain English, you understand it.
<br>
        <h2>Plan</h2>
        Now that you know what you’re aiming to solve, don’t jump into coding just yet. It’s time to plan out how you’re going to solve it first. Some of the questions you should answer at this stage of the process:
<br>
<ul>
    <li>Does your program have a user interface? What will it look like? What functionality will the interface have? Sketch this out on paper.</li>
    <li>What inputs will your program have? Will the user enter data or will you get input from somewhere else? </li>
    <li>What’s the desired output? </li>
    <li>Given your inputs, what are the steps necessary to return the desired output? </li>
</ul>
The last question is where you will write out an algorithm to solve the problem. You can think of an algorithm as a recipe for solving a particular problem. It defines the steps that need to be taken by the computer to solve a problem in pseudocode. <br>

        <h2>Pseudocode</h2>
        Pseudocode is writing out the logic for your program in natural language instead of code. It helps you slow down and think through the steps your program will have to go through to solve the problem.
    </p>

    <h2>The 8 data types of JavaScript are:</h2>
    <p><b>Number</b>: represents both integer and floating-point numbers.
    <br><b>String</b>: represents a sequence of characters enclosed within quotes.
    <br><b>Boolean</b>: represents a logical value, either true or false.
    <br><b>Undefined</b>: represents a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value.
    <br><b>Null</b>: represents the intentional absence of any object value.
    <br><b>Symbol</b>: represents a unique value that's not equal to any other value.
    <br><b>Object</b>: represents a collection of properties, and each property is a key-value pair.
    <br><b>BigInt</b>: represents integers with arbitrary precision.
    <br>It's important to note that JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, meaning that you don't have to specify the data type of a variable when you declare it. Instead, the data type is inferred based on the value assigned to the variable.</p>
